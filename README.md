# SHOWBIZZ 
An amazing MERN stack CRUD application that lets you write blogs on your favourite TV shows!!

# Why did I choose this project
I absolutely love reading, writing, and watching TV shows in my leisure time. To combine these interests into a fun project, I decided to create a CRUD application centered around TV show reviews and discussions. Rather than a traditional blog, this application allows users to share their opinions on TV shows they've watched and engage in discussions with others.

# What does this application allow you to do
This is a simple yet fun application to write about your favourite TV shows. Some of its features are:

* You can create an account for yourself to write your own blogs.
* You can read the blogs written by others. 
* You can click on individual authors to check out their work.
* You can browse posts according to different categories.

# Tech Stack used for this application

* Frontend 
  - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **React-Router-Dom**: A library for managing routing and navigation in React applications.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly styling web applications.

* Backend 
  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for server-side scripting.
  - **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL document database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
